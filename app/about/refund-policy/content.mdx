When you make a booking with us, we kindly ask for payment upfront to secure your spot. We're a small studio, and this helps us plan and prepare materials for your awesome ceramics experience.

Now, if for any reason you need to cancel your booking, we're more than happy to refund your payment, as long as you give us at least 48 hours' notice. We totally get that life happens, and we want to accommodate you as much as we can.

However, if you cancel within 48 hours of your scheduled booking, we won't be able to issue a refund. We've got to consider our instructors' time and effort, as well as any materials that might have been prepared specifically for your session.

We strive to create a relaxed and friendly environment, and we hope you understand the importance of this policy. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in helping us keep Malina More Studio running smoothly.

Thanks for choosing our studio. We can't wait to have a blast with you and create some amazing masterpieces together!
